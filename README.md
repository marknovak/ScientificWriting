# Scientific Writing
This repo will eventually contain the materials for _IB 514 Scientific Writing_, a graduate course in the department of Integrative Biology at Oregon State University.

The course is slated to be taught for the first time in Spring term of 2026 on Mondays and Wednesdays 12-1:50p.

## Official course description
Develops skills and strategies for producing clear, effective scientific manuscripts and professional documents. Covers the full writing process, including writing habits, workflow management, journal selection, and the peer review and publication process. Explores best practices for integrating literature, using reference managers, and adopting alternative writing and word-processing tools. Emphasizes practical, hands-on experience through real-world scientific writing, peer feedback, and collaborative accountability.

## Unofficial requirement
_Unofficial only because we can’t make it an official prerequisite._

Students must be ready to start writing a scientific manuscript the first week of the term.  What does “be ready” mean?  That’s for you and your advisor(s) to decide.  That said, being ready does not mean being 100% done with your analyses or having all your final figures drafted.  (A key lesson of the course is that writing can and should start much earlier than that.)  However, you do need to be far enough along to know what your paper’s main story arc and primary message will be. (Feel free to contact me if you’re unsure.)
