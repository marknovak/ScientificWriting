% This script will pull the tex-created pdfs of all specified classe notes together into one pdf container

\documentclass{report}
\usepackage{pdfpages}


% Note: there are two ways to pull LaTeX documents together.  This tex file simply combines 
%pre-compiled pdfs.  The other is to pull together and compile the individual tex files together (which 
%requires those files not having their own preamble setups).
