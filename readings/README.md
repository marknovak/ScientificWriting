# Readings
This folder contains:
- [pdfs](pdfs) of all the required and suggested readings for the course;
- [unfiled pdfs](unfiled_readings) which still need to be organized and added to the bib file;
- a [ScientificWriting.bib](ScientificWriting.bib) file containing the citations of all the (filed) readings (for use with any reference management software capable of reading BibTex (LaTeX) items), organized into static folders by class topic.

It [_will eventually_] also contain [course_notes](course_notes) which pulls all the LaTeX-created course notes pdfs from the various class folders into a single pdf. (Be sure to compile the tex to get the latest versions.)
