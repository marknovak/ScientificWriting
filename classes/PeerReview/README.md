# Peer Review and Publication Process

Peer review stages; editor, reviewer and author perspectives; responding to reviewer feedback, revision and resubmission; rejection management; page charges and proofing process.

### Required readings (_before class_)


### To do (_before class_)
- Read/skim the full "_peer review history_" of 2 or 3 published papers.
(_Look for a link at the top or bottom of an article's online version.  See below for a set of journals that publish the peer review history of their articles._)
You don't need to understand/explain the discussion, but come to class prepared to summarize and discuss the format (structure) and nature (e.g., professionalism, detail) of the editors decisions, the reviews, and the author's responses.

### Transparent review journals (_unordered examples_)
_Open peer review_ generally refers to disclosing the identities of reviewers to authors (and sometimes the public), while _transparent peer review_ focuses on publishing the actual review reports, editor decisions, and author responses alongside the final article, often while keeping reviewers anonymous. 

You can also access the peer review history of many articles via [Clarivate's Web Of Science](https://clarivate.com/academia-government/blog/introducing-open-peer-review-content-in-the-web-of-science/) database.  (You will need to be on campus, running a [VPN](https://technology.oregonstate.edu/services/vpn), or connect via the [library](https://library.oregonstate.edu) to access the WoS.)
