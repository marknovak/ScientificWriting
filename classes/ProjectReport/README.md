# End-of-Term Status Report

*Project Status, Successes & Challenges, Action Plan.*

## Purpose & Submission
This assignment requires you to deliver a concise account of the current status of your manuscript. The goal is not to “declare completion,” but to assess progress: What is finished? What remains? What specific steps will move the manuscript to submission?

You are again limited to just **_three slides_**.  Your slides should reflect clarity, prioritization, and accountability.

Submit your slides as a _single PDF_ to me by email _at least_ 2 hours before class.  
The order of the presentations will be random unless you write to me to request a specific time.


## Structure

See [ProjectReportSlides_GoodBad.pdf]([classes/ProjectProposal/ProjectReportSlides_GoodBad.pdf]) for example slides.

### Slide 1: Project Status

This slide should answer:
*Where does the manuscript stand right now?*

Include:

- Full manuscript title
- Target journal (specific, not “or similar”)
- Current status, using concrete metrics:

  * Word count
  * Draft completeness (e.g., full draft complete, partial draft)
  * Figure status (number complete, in progress)
  * Supplementary materials status
  * Co-author review status
  * Analyses underway or pending

The emphasis is specificity. Statements such as “still editing” or “mostly done” are not sufficient. Quantify and categorize progress.



### Slide 2: Successes and Challenges

This slide should answer:
*What improved, and what remains structurally or strategically unresolved?*

Include:
 - Key Successes (Be concrete);
 - Remaining Challenges (Identify substantive issues, avoid vague statements such as “writing is hard” or “needs polishing,” and diagnose the problem precisely);
- Process Insight (_Optional but encouraged_) Reflect on what worked or did not work in your writing process, such as 
    - Structured writing blocks
    - Accountability systems
    - Reference management workflow
    - Revision strategy.

This reflection should be analytic, not emotional.



### Slide 3: Feedback and Action Plan

This slide should answer:
*What feedback remains to be incorporated, and what is the concrete path to submission?*

Include:
- Structured Summary of Outstanding Feedback
    - List specific, actionable items from co-authors;
    - Each item should be stated as a revision task;
    - Avoid nonspecific summaries such as “clarify things” or “improve methods.”


- Revision Plan and Timeline
    - Regardless of project status, provide a realistic, staged plan. Include:
        * Internal deadlines
        * Co-author turnaround expectations
        * Submission target (specific timeframe)

Statements such as “revise soon” or “submit when ready” are not sufficient.
Timelines should reflect the actual state of the manuscript. 
If submission will not occur within four weeks, provide a structured timeline for the remaining work.
