# Manuscript Proposal Presentations

_Project topic, writing goals, target journal, timeline._

**Purpose**
This assignment requires you to articulate your scientific writing project clearly, concisely, and strategically. By constraining the proposal to three slides, the focus is on prioritization: what matters most for scope, audience, and feasibility.

You will present these slides briefly to the class to help you refine your project.  (See [ProjectProposalSlides_GoodBad.pdf]([classes/ProjectProposal/ProjectProposalSlides_GoodBad.pdf]) for example slides.)

### Slide 1: Project Overview

This slide should answer: *What are you writing, and why does it matter?*

Include:

* Working title and authors (tentative is fine)
* One–two sentence description of the scientific question or contribution
* Manuscript type (e.g., research article, review, data paper, methods paper)
* Intended audience (disciplinary community, subfield, or applied audience)

The goal is clarity and focus, not completeness.

### Slide 2: Structure, Scope, and Message

This slide should answer: *What will this paper actually contain?*

Include:

* High-level outline of the manuscript structure (e.g., IMRaD or alternative)
* Key data sources, analyses, or literature base
* Take-home message (the paper’s primary, most-important message)


### Slide 3: Journal Strategy and Timeline

This slide should answer: *Where will this be submitted, and how will you get there?*

Include:

* Three ranked candidate journals with brief justification for fit
* Anticipated manuscript length and format constraints
* Major writing milestones and internal deadlines

Journal choices should reflect audience, scope, and strategic considerations rather than prestige alone.
Emphasize realism and feasibility within the course timeline.

**Submission and Presentation**
Submit the three slides as a single PDF. You will give a brief (3–5 minute) presentation to the class.

**Notes**
This presentation is a planning tool, not a commitment. Changes are expected as your writing develops, but deviations should be intentional and justified.
