# Manuscript Proposal Presentations

_Project Overview, Structure & Scope, Strategy & Timeline._

## Purpose & Submission
This assignment requires you to articulate your scientific writing project clearly, concisely, and strategically. 
By constraining the proposal to **_three slides_**, the focus is on prioritization: 
what matters most for scope, audience, and feasibility.

Submit your slides as a _single PDF_ to me by email _at least_ 2 hours before class.
The order of the presentations will be random unless you write to me to request a specific time.


**Note:** This presentation is a planning tool, not a commitment. Changes are expected as your writing develops, but deviations should be intentional and justified.


## Structure

See [ProjectProposalSlides_GoodBad.pdf]([classes/ProjectProposal/ProjectProposalSlides_GoodBad.pdf]) for examples.

### Slide 1: Project Overview

This slide should answer: *What are you writing, and why does it matter?*

Include:

* Working title and co-authors (tentative is fine)
* One or two sentence description of the scientific question or contribution
* Take-home message (the paper’s primary, most-important message)
* Manuscript type (e.g., research article, review, data paper, methods paper)
* Intended audience (disciplinary community, subfield, or applied audience)

The goal is clarity and focus, not completeness.

### Slide 2: Structure, Scope, and Message

This slide should answer: *What will this paper actually contain?*

Include:

* High-level outline of the manuscript structure (e.g., IMRaD or alternative)
* Key data sources, analyses, or literature base
* Scope (i.e., what could it but won't it include)


### Slide 3: Journal Strategy and Timeline

This slide should answer: *Where will this be submitted, and how will you get there?*

Include:

* Three or more ranked candidate journals with brief justification for fit
* Anticipated manuscript length and format constraints (for first or all journals)
* Major writing milestones and internal deadlines

Journal choices should reflect audience, scope, and strategic considerations rather than prestige alone.
Emphasize realism and feasibility within the course timeline.
