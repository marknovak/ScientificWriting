# Major Assignments

This course is organized around a single, sustained scientific writing project that you will develop, revise, and refine over the term. Assignments emphasize process, iteration, and professional practice rather than one-time products.

See [rubrics](course_info/rubrics) for assessment criteria.

## 1. Writing Workflow & Habits Portfolio

**Purpose**
This assignment focuses on building a sustainable, self-aware scientific writing practice. Rather than prescribing a single “correct” approach, the goal is for you to identify, test, and refine habits and tools that work for your research context.

**What you will do**
Over the first two weeks of the course, you will:

* Design a realistic writing schedule that includes protected writing time
* Experiment with time-management or tracking tools (e.g., calendars, timers, blockers)
* Maintain a brief writing log documenting when, how, and what you write
* Reflect on barriers to writing (e.g., procrastination, perfectionism, writer’s block) and strategies you used to address them

**What you will submit**
A short portfolio (3–4 pages total) that includes:

* Your writing plan and schedule
* A description of tools used and why
* A summarized writing log
* A reflective narrative on what did and did not work

This portfolio may evolve over the term, but grading is based on evidence of engagement, experimentation, and reflection—not on productivity or word count.

## 2. Manuscript Proposal: 3-Slide Presentation

**Purpose**
This assignment requires you to articulate your scientific writing project clearly, concisely, and strategically. By constraining the proposal to three slides, the focus is on prioritization: what matters most for scope, audience, and feasibility.

You will present these slides briefly to the class to help you refine your project.  (See [ProjectProposalSlides_GoodBad.pdf]([classes/ProjectProposal/ProjectProposalSlides_GoodBad.pdf]) for example slides.)

### Slide 1: Project Overview

This slide should answer: *What are you writing, and why does it matter?*

Include:

* Working title and authors (tentative is fine)
* One–two sentence description of the scientific question or contribution
* Manuscript type (e.g., research article, review, data paper, methods paper)
* Intended audience (disciplinary community, subfield, or applied audience)

The goal is clarity and focus, not completeness.

### Slide 2: Structure, Scope, and Message

This slide should answer: *What will this paper actually contain?*

Include:

* High-level outline of the manuscript structure (e.g., IMRaD or alternative)
* Key data sources, analyses, or literature base
* Take-home message (the paper’s primary, most-important message)

### Slide 3: Journal Strategy and Timeline

This slide should answer: *Where will this be submitted, and how will you get there?*

Include:

* Three ranked candidate journals with brief justification for fit
* Anticipated manuscript length and format constraints
* Major writing milestones and internal deadlines

Journal choices should reflect audience, scope, and strategic considerations rather than prestige alone.
Emphasize realism and feasibility within the course timeline.


**Submission and Presentation**
Submit the three slides as a single PDF. You will give a brief (3–5 minute) presentation to the class.

**Notes**
This presentation is a planning tool, not a commitment. Changes are expected as your writing develops, but deviations should be intentional and justified.

## 3. Annotated Manuscript Drafts

**Purpose**
This assignment emphasizes iterative drafting, structural decision-making, and revision. You will submit multiple drafts of your manuscript over the term, each focused on specific sections or components.

**What you will do**
Across the course, you will submit staged drafts that may include:

* Introduction and conceptual framing
* Methods or equivalent technical sections
* Results and figures
* Discussion or synthesis

Each draft should reflect your current best thinking, not a placeholder.

**Annotations**
Each draft must include annotations (e.g., margin comments) that:

* Identify areas of uncertainty or concern
* Explain structural or stylistic choices
* Note planned revisions or unresolved questions

**Revision expectation**
Later drafts should show clear evidence of substantive revision, including reorganization, rewriting, or reframing—not just surface-level editing.

## 4. Peer Review & Collaboration Portfolio

**Purpose**
This assignment develops your ability to function as both a reviewer and a collaborator, mirroring real scientific writing and publication contexts.

**What you will do**
You will:

* Provide written peer reviews on classmates’ drafts
* Receive and respond to feedback on your own writing
* Reflect on collaboration dynamics, authorship norms, and the use of AI tools

**What you will submit**
A portfolio containing:

* Two written peer reviews you provided
* One response-to-review letter addressing feedback you received
* A brief statement on authorship expectations, contribution tracking, and AI use

Peer reviews should be specific, constructive, and grounded in the perspective of a journal reviewer, not a copy editor.

## 5. Final Manuscript & Reflective Memo

**Purpose**
This assignment integrates all course components into a polished, professional writing product.

**What you will submit**

* A submission-ready manuscript formatted for your target journal
* A draft cover letter addressed to the journal editor

“Submission-ready” means that the manuscript could realistically be submitted after the course, even if further revisions are planned.
